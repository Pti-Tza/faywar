# Project Intelligence

[Patterns]
- Don't use EventBus, use instances instead, example
    (static var instance : BattleController
    
    func _init() -> void:
    instance=self
    )
- Don't couple UI Logic and Game Logic
[Component Naming]
- Use _handler suffix for runtime components
- _data suffix for resource definitions

[Signal Convention]
- Past tense for completed actions
- Present tense for state changes

[Damage Propagation]
1. AttackSystem -> UnitHandler
2. UnitHandler -> SectionHandler
3. SectionHandler -> ComponentHandler

[AI Priorities]
- Berserker: Always closes distance
- Sniper: Prefers elevation advantage

[Testing Rules]
- Validate all 2D6 rolls against histogram
- Test movement costs at max grid range
